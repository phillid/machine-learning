What?
=====
This is a very simple implementation of machine learning whereby a machine can learn labels for n-dimensional vectors.
I knocked it up in about two hours and so it isn't really presentable or clean.
There is a lot of room for improvement, as shown in the GitHub issues for this project.

Note
====
This code is very simplistic and needs a fair amount of refactoring before it can be remotely educational.
